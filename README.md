# Sales Prediction in Ecuadorian Stores

## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the project on sales prediction for a chain of stores in Ecuador using historical sales data. The project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to forecast sales effectively, leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle's "Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting" competition. This solution aims to enhance inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies through accurate sales predictions.

## Background
The retail industry's success heavily relies on the ability to predict future sales accurately. With the advent of machine learning and data analytics, retailers now have powerful tools to enhance their forecasting accuracy, leading to improved operational efficiency and increased profitability. Our project taps into these advancements to provide actionable insights into consumer demand patterns.

## Problem Description
Predicting sales in retail involves multiple challenges, primarily due to the numerous factors affecting sales outcomes such as economic conditions, promotional activities, and seasonal trends. The project addresses these complexities by developing a robust model capable of forecasting sales with high accuracy using historical data. The dataset includes daily sales data, which presents both an opportunity for detailed analysis and a challenge due to its voluminous nature.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, from Kaggle's "Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting" competition, includes time-series records of daily sales, store details, product categories, and promotional activities. It encompasses various auxiliary files enriching this data:

Store Information - Details on the location, type, and cluster of each store, grouping those with similar characteristics.

Economic Indicators - Daily oil prices are included as they reflect Ecuador's economic health, which directly impacts consumer spending due to the country's sensitivity to oil price fluctuations.

Calendar Events - Information on holidays and significant events, including any adjustments to their observance, which can influence sales patterns significantly.

## Summary
The project also underscores the importance of meticulous data preprocessing and feature engineering, which significantly enhance model performance. In preparation for training, we employed a robust data pipeline along with categorical encoding techniques to ensure the data was optimally formatted and ready for model ingestion. To safeguard against overfitting, we applied a combination of strategies, including the integration of early stopping mechanisms, the utilization of regularization methods, and the incorporation of dropout layers within the network architecture. These measures are designed to enhance the model's ability to generalize and perform reliably on unseen data. By integrating diverse datasets such as economic indicators and holiday schedules, the model can more accurately reflect the factors influencing consumer behavior. The effective use of CNNs to extract spatial relationships and LSTMs to analyze temporal patterns exemplifies the potential of hybrid approaches in predictive analytics.
